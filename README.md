Forecasting Dominos ($DPZ) Stock Price with Classical, ML, and Deep Learning Methods

Packages Used: pandas, NumPy, statsmodels, scikit-learn, LightGBM, Tensorflow/Keras

Inspired by my love for pizza and statistics. I fit ARIMA, Ridge, Random Forests, LightGBM, and a stacked LSTM to forecast the time series.
